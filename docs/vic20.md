# VIC-20 Emulator

## Quick start

```
dotnet run --project src/Host.Vic20 -- \
  --basic basic.901486-01.bin \
  --kernal kernal.901486-07.bin \
  --char chargen.901460-03.bin
```

## ROM images

The VIC-20 requires three ROM dumps. These are widely available from community ROM archives (search for "VIC-20 ROM set"):

| Flag | File | Size | Description |
|------|------|------|-------------|
| `--basic` | `basic.901486-01.bin` | 8 KB | BASIC V2 ROM |
| `--kernal` | `kernal.901486-07.bin` | 8 KB | Kernal ROM (PAL) |
| `--char` | `chargen.901460-03.bin` | 4 KB | Character generator ROM |

The character ROM is optional — if omitted the screen will show blank glyphs.

## Command-line options

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `--basic <path>` | required | 8 KB BASIC ROM |
| `--kernal <path>` | required | 8 KB Kernal ROM |
| `--char <path>` | — | 4 KB character ROM |
| `--tape <path>` | — | Commodore TAP tape image |
| `--scale <n>` | 3 | Window scale factor |

## Address map

| Range | Device | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| `$0000–$00FF` | RAM | Zero page |
| `$0100–$01FF` | RAM | Stack |
| `$0200–$03FF` | RAM | System area |
| `$0400–$0FFF` | Open bus | Returns $FF |
| `$1000–$1FFF` | RAM | 4 KB main RAM (unexpanded) |
| `$2000–$7FFF` | Open bus | Expansion RAM area |
| `$8000–$83FF` | Colour RAM | 4-bit per cell, CPU read/write |
| `$9000–$900F` | VIC-I | Video and audio registers |
| `$9110–$911F` | VIA 1 | Serial bus, tape, joystick |
| `$9120–$912F` | VIA 2 | Keyboard matrix, joystick |
| `$A000–$BFFF` | Expansion cartridge (Block 5) | Unmapped on unexpanded VIC-20 |
| `$C000–$DFFF` | BASIC ROM | 8 KB, read-only |
| `$E000–$FFFF` | Kernal ROM | 8 KB; reset vector at `$FFFC/$FFFD` |

The character ROM (4 KB) is **not on the CPU bus** — it is accessed exclusively by the VIC-I chip at VIC address space `$0000–$0FFF`.

## VIC-I ($9000–$900F)

| Register | Address | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| 0 | `$9000` | Horizontal origin (×2 pixels, bits 6–0) |
| 1 | `$9001` | Vertical origin (scan lines) |
| 2 | `$9002` | Columns (bits 6–0) + screen base bit 9 (bit 7) |
| 3 | `$9003` | Rows (bits 6–1) + char height (bit 0) |
| 4 | `$9004` | Raster counter (read-only) |
| 5 | `$9005` | Screen base bits 13–10 (bits 7–4) + char base bits 13–10 (bits 3–0) |
| 10 | `$900A` | Bass oscillator frequency (bits 7–1) + on/off (bit 0) |
| 11 | `$900B` | Alto oscillator |
| 12 | `$900C` | Soprano oscillator |
| 13 | `$900D` | Noise oscillator |
| 14 | `$900E` | Aux colour (bits 7–4) + master volume (bits 3–0) |
| 15 | `$900F` | Background colour (bits 7–4) + border colour (bits 3–1) + reverse (bit 0) |

Default register state matches the unexpanded PAL VIC-20 Kernal startup: 22 columns, 23 rows, screen base `$1E00`, char base `$8000` (VIC addr `$0000` = char ROM).

## VIC-I address space and the dual-bus problem

### The hardware situation

The VIC-I has its own 14-bit address bus, independent of the 6502's 16-bit bus. The two buses share some physical RAM but are wired differently, which creates an overlap that is unusual for emulators to model.

The most important consequence is at `$8000` on the CPU bus:

- **The CPU** sees **colour RAM** at `$8000–$83FF` — 4-bit cells it reads and writes freely.
- **The VIC-I** sees the **character ROM** at VIC address `$0000–$0FFF` — the same physical address range, but the character ROM chip is selected on the VIC's bus while the colour RAM is selected on the CPU's bus. The two devices are never active simultaneously on the same bus cycle.

On the default unexpanded Kernal startup, `$9005` is `$F0`, which sets CharBase to VIC `$0000`. So every character fetch the VIC makes goes to `$0000–$0FFF` on its own bus — the char ROM — while the CPU continues to use `$8000` for colour data. They are physically separate chips on separate address lines; neither knows the other exists.

### How the emulator handles it

A naïve implementation would put the char ROM at `$8000` in the `AddressDecoder` and let the VIC read through the shared bus. This would break colour RAM: the CPU would read back char ROM bytes when it expects colour values.

Instead, the char ROM is held in a private `byte[]` inside `Vic20Machine` and is **never mapped onto the CPU bus at all**. The VIC-I's `ReadVicMemory` callback intercepts requests to VIC `$0000–$0FFF` (and the `$3000` mirror) and reads the byte array directly, bypassing the decoder entirely:

```csharp
private byte ReadVicMemory(ushort vicAddr)
{
    // Character ROM: VIC-only, not on CPU bus
    if (vicAddr <= 0x0FFF || (vicAddr >= 0x3000 && vicAddr <= 0x3FFF))
        return _charRom[vicAddr & 0x0FFF];

    ushort cpuAddr = vicAddr switch
    {
        >= 0x1000 and <= 0x1FFF => vicAddr,                    // main RAM
        >= 0x2000 and <= 0x2FFF => (ushort)(vicAddr & 0x0FFF), // zero-page mirror
        _                       => vicAddr,
    };
    return _bus.Read(cpuAddr);
}
```

For all other VIC address ranges the callback translates the VIC address to the equivalent CPU address and reads through the normal `AddressDecoder`, so screen RAM and zero-page mirrors work correctly.

### VIC-I address translation table

| VIC address | Mapped to | Contents |
|-------------|-----------|----------|
| `$0000–$0FFF` | `_charRom[addr]` | Character ROM (VIC-only) |
| `$1000–$1FFF` | CPU `$1000–$1FFF` | Main RAM — screen data lives here |
| `$2000–$2FFF` | CPU `$0000–$0FFF` | Zero page / stack mirror |
| `$3000–$3FFF` | `_charRom[addr & 0x0FFF]` | Character ROM mirror |

## VIA 1 ($9110–$911F) — tape and serial

| Bit | Port | Signal |
|-----|------|--------|
| PB3 | Port B out | Tape motor relay (1 = on) |
| CB1 | Input | Tape data in (edge-triggered) |

## VIA 2 ($9120–$912F) — keyboard

| Port | Direction | Signal |
|------|-----------|--------|
| Port B | Output | Column select (active low — drive column bit to 0 to scan it) |
| Port A | Input | Row data (active low — 0 = key pressed in that row) |

The keyboard matrix is 8 columns × 8 rows. See `Vic20KeyboardAdapter.cs` for the full layout.

## Audio

The VIC-I produces four sound channels mixed to mono 16-bit PCM at 44,100 Hz:

| Channel | Register | Type |
|---------|----------|------|
| Bass | `$900A` | Square wave |
| Alto | `$900B` | Square wave |
| Soprano | `$900C` | Square wave |
| Noise | `$900D` | 15-bit Galois LFSR |

Tone frequency: `1,108,405 / 128 / (256 − (reg & 0xFE))` Hz

## Tape format

TAP files use Commodore's pulse-width encoding. See [vic20-tape.md](vic20-tape.md) for the full format and adapter design.

## Machine class

```csharp
var machine = new Vic20Machine(
    basicRom,           // byte[] — 8 KB
    kernalRom,          // byte[] — 8 KB
    charRom:  charRom,  // byte[]? — 4 KB, optional
    keyboard: host,     // IPhysicalKeyboard?
    audio:    host,     // IAudioSink?
    tape:     tape);    // Vic20TapeAdapter?

machine.Reset();

// Per-frame loop:
machine.RunFrame();        // ~22,168 CPU cycles at PAL 50 Hz
machine.RenderFrame(host); // 256×272 ARGB32 → IVideoSink
```
